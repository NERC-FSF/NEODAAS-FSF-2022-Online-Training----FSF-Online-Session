    "# Tutorial Two -- Industrial Waste Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "An ore smelting company wants to create a report on how the waste materials that they produce can be observed from Sentinel-2 imagery. They have provided you (in the **Data** folder) with a collection of reflectance spectra, collected using an ASD FieldSpec Pro 3 with contact probe attachment in reference to **SRT 44**, and measured in an air conditioned laboratory. They have set their instrument to automatically correct for overlaps and jumps. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with the following:\n",
    "- To produce, from the reflectance spectra, a PDF output and associated .csv of the averaged, corrected spectra for each type of industrial waste\n",
    "- To convolve the averaged, corrected, grouped spectra for each sample to Sentinel-2 bands\n",
    "- To calculate from the convolved output the values of the Ferrous Minerals Index (FMI) for each group, which is determined from the following equation:\n",
